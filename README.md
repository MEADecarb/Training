## Grant Agreements 
[Grant Agreements](https://github.com/MEADecarb/Wiki/blob/main/Grant%20Agreements.drawio.pdf) function similarly to contracts. They are executed after an award has been granted. The same process is followed for a Commitment Letter. A Commitment Letter is used to encumber the funds, ensuring that the allocated money is reserved for the specific project or purpose.
