Rec Memos are a summary of the Grant Program, the applications, and the review process. The Rec Memo documents the reasons why an award should be made and the amount. The Rec Memo also provides the first estimation of the impact of the program. The Grant Program Review Team makes the recommendation to the MEA Director who approves the awards. 

## Grant Agreements

Grant Agreements function similarly to contracts. They are executed after an award has been granted. The same process is followed for a Commitment Letter. A Commitment Letter is used to encumber the funds, ensuring that the allocated money is reserved for the specific project or purpose.
